# Comprehensive Vedic Jyotish Calculation Service: Architectural Roadmap

## Foundational Vision

A meticulously engineered web-based Vedic Jyotish calculation engine delivering unparalleled depth of astrological analysis while maintaining classical authenticity. This service will prioritize computational precision in planetary calculations, provide comprehensive divisional chart systems, and implement authentic Vedic predictive methodologiesâ€”all presented through an intuitive, modern interface designed for both traditional practitioners and contemporary users.

## Core Architectural Principles

- **Vedic Authenticity:** Strict adherence to classical Jyotish frameworks with no Western astrological influences
- **Calculation Precision:** Ephemeris-driven accuracy to the second of arc for all planetary positions
- **Analytical Depth:** Comprehensive implementation of all classical Jyotish parameters and techniques
- **Modular Scalability:** Component-based architecture allowing systematic expansion of analytical features
- **Intuitive Presentation:** Modern interface design that respects traditional symbolism while enhancing accessibility
