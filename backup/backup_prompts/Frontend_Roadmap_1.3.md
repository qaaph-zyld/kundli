# Frontend Roadmap 1.3 - Vedic Kundli Calculator

This roadmap outlines the frontend development plan for the Vedic Kundli Calculator, focusing on enhancing the user interface and experience while maintaining compatibility with the backend implementation defined in MVP_Roadmap_1.2.

## Core Principles

- **Vedic Authenticity**: Adhere strictly to Vedic astrology principles and calculations
- **User Experience**: Create an intuitive, responsive interface for astrological data
- **Performance**: Optimize rendering and data visualization for smooth operation
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the application is usable across different devices and by users with varying abilities

## Frontend Features Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Core Visualization 
- [x] **Basic Chart Rendering**: D3.js-based birth chart visualization
- [x] **Responsive Layout**: Bootstrap-based responsive design
- [x] **Planetary Information Display**: Basic planetary positions and details
- [x] **Form Handling**: Birth data input form with validation

### Phase 2: Advanced Data Presentation 
- [x] **Tabbed Interface**: Organized presentation of different astrological components
- [x] **Planetary Dignity Visualization**: Color-coded planetary strength indicators
- [x] **Dasha System Display**: Vimshottari dasha periods with interactive elements
- [x] **Panchang Details**: Tithi, Nakshatra, Yoga, and Karana information
- [x] **Divisional Charts**: D9 (Navamsha) and D12 (Dwadashamsha) chart visualizations

### Phase 3: Enhanced Astrological Features 
- [x] **Yoga Detection and Display**: Identification and explanation of planetary yogas
- [x] **Ashtakavarga System**: Visualization of bindus and sarvashtakavarga
- [x] **Shadbala Calculation Display**: Comprehensive planetary strength visualization
- [x] **Vimsopaka Bala Display**: 20-point strength system based on divisional charts

### Phase 4: Advanced Visualization (In Progress)

- [ ] **Interactive Chart Elements**: Clickable planets and houses with detailed information
- [ ] **Transit Chart Overlay**: Current planetary positions overlaid on birth chart
- [ ] **Aspect Visualization**: Visual representation of planetary aspects and relationships
- [ ] **Chart Comparison Tool**: Side-by-side comparison of two birth charts

### Phase 5: User Experience Enhancements

- [ ] **Customizable Themes**: Light/dark mode and color scheme options
- [ ] **Printable Reports**: Formatted PDF export of chart analysis
- [ ] **Saved Charts Management**: User interface for managing saved birth charts
- [ ] **Guided Interpretation**: Step-by-step walkthrough of chart elements and meanings

### Phase 6: Advanced Features

- [ ] **Predictive Timeline**: Visual timeline of upcoming astrological events
- [ ] **Muhurta Tool**: Auspicious time selection interface
- [ ] **Remedial Measures**: Suggestions based on chart analysis
- [ ] **Educational Resources**: Integrated learning materials about Vedic astrology

## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### Visualization Technologies
- **D3.js**: Primary library for chart visualization
- **Bootstrap**: Framework for responsive layout and UI components
- **JavaScript ES6+**: Modern JavaScript for frontend logic

### Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading of complex visualizations
- Efficient DOM manipulation and rendering
- Data caching for repeated calculations

### Accessibility Standards
- WCAG 2.1 compliance for core functionality
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility for essential information

## Development Workflow

1. Follow the existing Development_protocol.md for all implementation work
2. Maintain compatibility with backend features as defined in MVP_Roadmap_1.2
3. Implement frontend features in the order specified by this roadmap
4. Test each feature thoroughly before moving to the next phase
5. Update documentation as features are completed

## Current Focus

The team is currently working on Phase 4: Advanced Visualization, specifically implementing interactive chart elements and aspect visualization to enhance user engagement with the astrological data.
