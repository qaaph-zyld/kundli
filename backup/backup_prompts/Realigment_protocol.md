## Implementation Verification Protocol

### Calculation Validation Framework
- Develop test suite comparing results against classical reference charts
- Implement automated verification of planetary positions against standard ephemeris
- Create house placement validation system confirming accurate Whole Sign implementation
- Establish continuous monitoring system for calculation consistency across modules

### Reference Integration System
- Document explicit ayanamsa and house system parameters in all calculation outputs
- Provide classical textual references supporting implemented methodologies
- Create detailed technical documentation explaining ayanamsa application across modules
- Develop comprehensive system architecture documentation highlighting Whole Sign implementation

## User Interface Adaptation

### Configuration Management Interface
- Implement clear ayanamsa selection with current Lahiri default
- Provide informational context explaining ayanamsa significance and selection rationale
- Display current ayanamsa and house system parameters in all chart visualizations
- Create educational resources explaining traditional Whole Sign methodology

### Visualization Framework
- Adapt chart rendering to emphasize Whole Sign house boundaries
- Implement visual indicators for ayanamsa-sensitive chart components
- Design information hierarchy highlighting traditional Vedic interpretative elements
- Create consistent symbolic language maintaining classical Vedic representations

### House System Implementation Verification
- **Current Implementation:** The system correctly uses the Whole Sign house system as specified in MVP_Roadmap_1.2
- **Swiss Ephemeris Configuration:** Using 'W' parameter in swe.houses_ex() calls to specify Whole Sign system
- **House Calculation Logic:** Houses are correctly determined by the sign position relative to the ascendant sign
- **Verification Process:**
  1. Confirmed house calculation in _calculate_houses() method follows Whole Sign principles
  2. Verified _get_house_number() method correctly calculates houses based on sign position
  3. Confirmed Swiss Ephemeris calls use 'W' parameter for Whole Sign system
  4. Validated that house assignments in planet data match Whole Sign expectations

This verification confirms that our implementation adheres to the Whole Sign house system as required, where the sign containing the ascendant becomes the 1st house, and subsequent signs follow in order as houses 2-12.

This architectural framework ensures strict alignment with classical Vedic Jyotish principles by standardizing all calculations on Lahiri ayanamsa and the Whole Sign house system while maintaining computational accuracy and authentic methodological integrity throughout the system.
