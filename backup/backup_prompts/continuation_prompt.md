# Vedic Kundli Calculator Project Continuation Prompt

## Project Overview
The Vedic Kundli Calculator is a web-based application that provides accurate Vedic astrological calculations and chart visualization. The application follows strict adherence to classical Vedic astrology principles, using the Lahiri ayanamsa and Whole Sign house system exclusively.

## Current Implementation Status
1. **Core Calculation Engine**:
   - High-precision planetary calculations using Swiss Ephemeris
   - Accurate ascendant (lagna) calculation with nakshatra and pada information
   - Whole Sign house system implementation (verified and documented)
   - Planetary dignity and retrograde status calculations

2. **User Interface**:
   - Modern, tabbed interface (Chart, Planets, Dasha, Panchang)
   - D3.js-based chart visualization with enhanced ascendant marker
   - Color-coded planetary dignities
   - Proper formatting for degrees, minutes, and seconds
   - Zodiac and planetary symbols

3. **Recent Enhancements**:
   - Added dedicated section for ascendant display in Chart tab
   - Enhanced chart visualization with prominent ascendant marker
   - Added ascendant section in Planets tab
   - Implemented nakshatra pada calculations

## Development Guidelines
1. **Architectural Requirements**:
   - Use only Lahiri ayanamsa for calculations
   - Implement only the Whole Sign house system
   - Follow MVP_Roadmap_1.2 as the sole plan until 100% completion
   - Proceed according to Development_protocol.md

2. **Implementation Principles**:
   - Only Vedic astrology features will be added (no Western astrology)
   - Maintain existing capabilities when adding new features
   - Run the application after each feature addition for verification
   - Update GitHub repository after each confirmed feature

## Verification Completed
- Confirmed that the house system implementation correctly uses Whole Sign
- Verified Swiss Ephemeris calls use 'W' parameter for Whole Sign system
- Documented verification in Realigment_protocol.md

## Next Steps
Continue implementing features from MVP_Roadmap_1.2, focusing on:
1. Comprehensive divisional chart implementation
2. Advanced strength calculation architecture
3. Predictive framework implementation
4. Specialized analytical modules
