# Vedic Kundli Calculator Continuation Prompt

## Current Project Status

We have successfully implemented the following features:
- Complete architectural restructuring with clean domain-driven design
- Database-backed repository pattern with SQLAlchemy models
- Repository factory for dynamic repository selection (in-memory/database)
- Enhanced Transit Progression Engine with detailed effects and timeline integration
- Advanced Dasha Analysis foundation with entity models and repository interfaces

## Next Steps

### 1. Complete Advanced Dasha Analysis
- Implement SQLAlchemy model and repository for Dasha Analysis
- Create Dasha Calculator service with support for:
  - Extended Pratyantardasha level calculations
  - Multiple Dasha systems (Vimshottari, Yogini, Jaimini, etc.)
  - Comprehensive Dasha Phala with classical references
  - Interactive Dasha timeline visualization
- Develop API routes for Dasha Analysis operations
- Integrate with Transit Engine for combined predictions

### 2. Implement Specialized Divisional Chart Analysis
- Create dedicated entities and repositories for divisional charts
- Implement specialized analysis for key vargas (D-9, D-10, D-12, etc.)
- Add interpretive text with classical references
- Develop comparative strength assessment across vargas
- Create visualization components for divisional chart comparisons

### 3. Technical Debt & Optimization
- Implement caching layer with Redis
- Add asynchronous task queue with Celery for long-running calculations
- Optimize database queries and add indexes
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
- Expand test coverage with unit and integration tests
- Add benchmarking for performance optimization

### 4. Frontend Integration
- Update React components to consume new API endpoints
- Create visualization components for:
  - Transit timelines
  - Dasha period analysis
  - Divisional chart comparisons
- Implement state management for complex astrological data
- Add user preference management for calculation options

## Implementation Priorities
1. Complete the Dasha Analysis implementation first
2. Then implement Specialized Divisional Chart Analysis
3. Address Technical Debt & Optimization
4. Complete Frontend Integration

## Architectural Guidelines
- Maintain strict separation of concerns (entities, repositories, use cases, services)
- Follow clean architecture principles
- Ensure all features have proper error handling and validation
- Document all APIs and components
- Adhere to Vedic astrology principles (no Western astrology features)
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing features
