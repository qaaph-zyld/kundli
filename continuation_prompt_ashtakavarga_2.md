# Vedic Kundli Calculator Project Continuation Prompt: Ashtakavarga System Enhancement

## Project Overview
The Vedic Kundli Calculator is a web-based application that provides accurate Vedic astrological calculations and chart visualization. The application follows strict adherence to classical Vedic astrology principles, using the Lahiri ayanamsa and Whole Sign house system exclusively.

## Current Implementation Status (78% Complete)
1. **Core Calculation Engine**:
   - High-precision planetary calculations using Swiss Ephemeris
   - Accurate ascendant (lagna) calculation with nakshatra and pada information
   - Whole Sign house system implementation (verified and documented)
   - Planetary dignity and retrograde status calculations
   - Ashtakavarga system for planetary and house strength evaluation
   - Shadbala and Vimsopaka Bala calculations
   - Yoga Identification System

2. **User Interface**:
   - Modern, tabbed interface (Chart, Planets, Dasha, Panchang, Yogas, Divisional, Ashtakavarga)
   - D3.js-based chart visualization with enhanced ascendant marker
   - Color-coded planetary dignities
   - Proper formatting for degrees, minutes, and seconds
   - Zodiac and planetary symbols
   - Comprehensive Ashtakavarga visualization with bindu counts
   - Yoga display with categorization and detailed descriptions

## Ashtakavarga System Enhancement Requirements

The Ashtakavarga system is a unique predictive tool in Vedic astrology that evaluates the strength of planets and houses based on a point system. While we have implemented the basic Ashtakavarga calculations, we need to enhance this feature with the following capabilities:

1. **Sarvashtakavarga Analysis**:
   - Calculate the combined Ashtakavarga (Sarvashtakavarga) for all planets
   - Implement Bhinna Ashtakavarga (individual planet's Ashtakavarga) and Samudaya Ashtakavarga (collective Ashtakavarga)
   - Add transit analysis using Ashtakavarga bindus

2. **Kaksha Vibhaga**:
   - Implement the Kaksha (sub-division) system within Ashtakavarga
   - Calculate the strength of each Kaksha and its significance

3. **Trikona Shodhana and Ekadhipatya Shodhana**:
   - Implement these reduction techniques to refine Ashtakavarga readings
   - Apply the appropriate reductions based on classical texts

4. **Ashtakavarga Predictions**:
   - Generate predictive insights based on Ashtakavarga scores
   - Identify favorable and unfavorable periods using Ashtakavarga transit analysis

5. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Create an interactive Ashtakavarga grid visualization
   - Add tooltips explaining the significance of bindu scores
   - Implement color-coding for strength indicators
   - Provide detailed explanations of Ashtakavarga principles

## Technical Considerations
- Maintain the existing code architecture and follow the established patterns
- Ensure all calculations are based on classical Vedic astrology texts
- Optimize performance for complex calculations
- Implement comprehensive error handling and validation
- Add detailed documentation for all new features

## Resources
- The existing Ashtakavarga module in `vedic_calculator/ashtakavarga.py`
- Classical references: Brihat Parasara Hora Shastra (Chapter 66-73), Phaladeepika (Chapter 16)
- The current UI implementation in `templates/index.html` and `static/js/kundli-chart.js`

## Expected Deliverables
1. Enhanced Ashtakavarga calculation module
2. Updated UI components for Ashtakavarga visualization
3. Documentation explaining the implementation details
4. Test cases validating the accuracy of calculations
5. Performance optimization for complex calculations

## Timeline
This enhancement is part of Phase 3 of our MVP roadmap and should be completed within the next development cycle.
