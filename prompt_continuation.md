Here's a prompt that will help you continue exactly where you left off in the Vedic Kundli Calculator project:

CopyInsert
I'm continuing development on the Vedic Kundli Calculator project. I've just implemented the correct ascendant calculation for Nikola's birth chart (Libra 28Â°55') and created test files to validate planetary positions against reference data.

The most recent work involved:
1. Creating a reference chart JSON file (nikola_reference_chart.json) with accurate planetary positions
2. Implementing test_planetary_positions.py to validate calculations against the reference data
3. Fixing parameter names in the tests (changing 'latitude'/'longitude' to 'lat'/'lon')
4. Removing the redundant calculator.calculate() call since the constructor already calls calculate_all()

Current issues that need addressing:
1. Some tests are failing with small discrepancies in planetary positions (Sun and Moon degrees)
2. The houses test is failing with KeyError: 'H1' suggesting house data structure issues
3. We need to ensure all planetary calculations match the reference data within acceptable tolerance

Please help me continue by:
1. Investigating why the house data structure doesn't contain expected keys
2. Adjusting the planetary position calculations to match the reference data
3. Ensuring all tests pass to validate the accuracy of our Vedic astrological calculations
4. Following strictly Vedic astrology principles with no Western influences

The project follows the MVP_Roadmap_1.2 and adheres to the Development_protocol.md guidelines.
