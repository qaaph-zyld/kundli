## Frontend Visual Design Philosophy

The interface serves as both a bridge and interpreter—translating the profound mathematical architecture of Jyotish principles into visual narratives that guide both traditional practitioners and contemporary seekers. The design language embraces the sacred geometry intrinsic to Vedic astrology while incorporating modern interaction patterns that reduce cognitive friction.

### Visual Language Establishment
- **Color System**: Palette derived from traditional elemental associations (Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Ether)
- **Typography Hierarchy**: Scale based on astronomical proportions with attention to legibility
- **Iconography Suite**: Comprehensive glyph system for planetary, zodiacal, and house symbology
- **Motion Grammar**: Subtle animation principles rooted in celestial movements

### Implementation Principles
1. **Sacred-Modern Fusion**: The interface honors traditional symbolism while leveraging contemporary interaction patterns
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Feature exposure follows a "simple to deep" pattern
3. **Narrative Visualization**: Charts tell stories through thoughtful data visualization
4. **Contemplative Interaction**: The interface rhythm encourages thoughtful exploration
5. **Astronomical Inspiration**: Interface animations and transitions echo celestial movements

## Technical Implementation Notes

1. **Ayanamsa System**: The implementation uses only the Lahiri ayanamsa as specified in the requirements, which is the standard for Vedic astrology calculations in India.

2. **House System**: Only the Whole Sign house system is implemented as per requirements, which is the traditional system used in Vedic astrology.

3. **Visualization Technologies**:
   - **D3.js**: Primary library for chart visualization
   - **Bootstrap**: Framework for responsive layout and UI components
   - **JavaScript ES6+**: Modern JavaScript for frontend logic

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Lazy loading of complex visualizations
   - Efficient DOM manipulation and rendering
   - Data caching for repeated calculations

5. **Accessibility Standards**:
   - WCAG 2.1 compliance for core functionality
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Screen reader compatibility for essential information
