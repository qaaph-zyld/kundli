# Vedic Kundli Calculator Project Status

## Project Overview
The Vedic Kundli Calculator is a web-based application that provides accurate Vedic astrological calculations and chart visualization. The application follows strict adherence to classical Vedic astrology principles, using the Lahiri ayanamsa and Whole Sign house system exclusively.

- Added pada (quarter) calculation for nakshatras ✓

### Ashtakavarga System
- Implemented complete Ashtakavarga system following classical Parashari rules ✓
- Added Prastarashtakavarga (individual planet Ashtakavarga) calculations ✓
- Added Sarvashtakavarga (combined Ashtakavarga) calculations ✓
- Implemented strength assessment for planets and houses based on bindu counts ✓
- Created UI for displaying Ashtakavarga data with interactive elements ✓

### Interactive Chart Elements
- Implemented interactive chart elements allowing users to click on planets and houses ✓
- Added tooltips for displaying quick information on hover ✓
- Created detailed information panels for planets and houses when clicked ✓
- Developed transit chart overlay feature showing current planetary positions ✓
- Added toggle switch for enabling/disabling transit overlay ✓
- Implemented visual differentiation between natal and transit planets ✓
- Added backend endpoint for calculating current transit positions ✓

## Ashtakavarga System Enhancement Requirements

The Ashtakavarga system needs enhancement with the following capabilities:

1. **Sarvashtakavarga Analysis**:
   - Calculate the combined Ashtakavarga (Sarvashtakavarga) for all planets
   - Implement Bhinna Ashtakavarga (individual planet's Ashtakavarga) and Samudaya Ashtakavarga (collective Ashtakavarga)
   - Add transit analysis using Ashtakavarga bindus

2. **Kaksha Vibhaga**:
   - Implement the Kaksha (sub-division) system within Ashtakavarga
   - Calculate the strength of each Kaksha and its significance

3. **Trikona Shodhana and Ekadhipatya Shodhana**:
   - Implement these reduction techniques to refine Ashtakavarga readings
   - Apply the appropriate reductions based on classical texts

4. **Ashtakavarga Predictions**:
   - Generate predictive insights based on Ashtakavarga scores
   - Identify favorable and unfavorable periods using Ashtakavarga transit analysis

## Verification Completed
- Confirmed that the house system implementation correctly uses Whole Sign
- Verified Swiss Ephemeris calls use 'W' parameter for Whole Sign system
- Documented verification in Realigment_protocol.md
- Verified Ashtakavarga calculations match classical Parashari rules
- Confirmed UI displays for Ashtakavarga data are accurate and user-friendly
- Verified interactive chart elements function correctly
- Confirmed transit overlay displays current planetary positions accurately

## Next Steps
Continue implementing features from the Unified Roadmap, focusing on:
1. Complete Shadbala calculation engine with six-fold strength parameters
2. Specialized strength metrics (Vimsopaka Bala, Ishta-Kashta Phala)
3. Additional dasha systems including Yogini, Kalachakra, and Ashtottari
4. Transit progression engine with date-based predictive indicators
5. Comprehensive Rajayoga detection and strength calculation
6. Aspect visualization and interpretation
7. Predictive timeline visualization
8. Enhanced divisional chart implementation
