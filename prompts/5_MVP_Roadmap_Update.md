   - Better handling of edge cases and special conditions

2. **Enhanced Visualization**
   - Graphical representation of strength distribution
   - Color-coded indicators for strong and weak planets
   - Comparative view of strength across different vargas

3. **Interpretive Content**
   - Textual interpretation of strength values
   - Recommendations based on planetary strengths
   - Classical references for interpretation guidelines

### Ishta-Kashta Phala Implementation
Ishta-Kashta Phala calculates the benefic and malefic effects of planets. The implementation will include:

1. **Comprehensive Calculation Engine**
   - Accurate assessment of benefic and malefic influences
   - Calculation of net effects on different areas of life
   - Integration with other strength parameters

2. **Detailed Analysis Interface**
   - Visual representation of benefic vs. malefic balance
   - Breakdown of effects by life area and planet
   - Timeline view of changing effects over time

3. **Predictive Applications**
   - Integration with dasha system for timing predictions
   - Correlation with transit effects
   - Remedial suggestions based on malefic influences

### Transit Progression Engine
The enhanced transit engine will provide detailed analysis of planetary transits and their effects:

1. **Advanced Transit Calculations**
   - Precise timing of planetary ingress into signs and houses
   - Calculation of aspect formation and dissolution
   - Identification of significant transit events

2. **Predictive Timeline**
   - Visual timeline of upcoming transits
   - Highlighting of significant transit periods
   - Integration with natal chart for personalized effects

3. **Combined Dasha-Transit Analysis**
   - Correlation between dasha periods and transits
   - Identification of intensified effects during overlaps
   - Comprehensive prediction framework based on classical principles

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach
1. **Incremental Feature Delivery**
   - Implement core functionality first, then enhance
   - Regular integration testing to ensure system stability
   - Continuous validation against classical references

2. **Quality Assurance**
   - Comprehensive test cases for each feature
   - Validation against known birth charts
   - Performance testing for calculation-intensive operations

3. **Documentation**
   - Detailed technical documentation for each calculation method
   - Classical references for astrological algorithms
   - User guides for interpreting results

## Success Metrics
The successful completion of the MVP will be measured by:

1. **Calculation Accuracy**
   - Less than 1% deviation from reference calculations
   - Consistent results across different chart types
   - Proper handling of edge cases and special conditions

2. **Feature Completeness**
   - Implementation of all planned features
   - Comprehensive coverage of classical Vedic astrology techniques
   - Integration of all components into a cohesive system
