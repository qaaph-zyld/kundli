- **Limitations**: MVP-level implementation lacking enterprise patterns

## Restructuring Objectives
1. **Architectural Excellence**: Implement clean architecture with clear separation of concerns
2. **Scalability Foundation**: Enable horizontal scaling and performance optimization
3. **Maintainability**: Establish modular design with testable components
4. **Feature Extensibility**: Prepare infrastructure for advanced astrological calculations
