# Vedic Kundli Calculator Project Continuation Prompt

## Project Overview
The Vedic Kundli Calculator is a web-based application that provides accurate Vedic astrological calculations and chart visualization. The application follows strict adherence to classical Vedic astrology principles, using the Lahiri ayanamsa and Whole Sign house system exclusively.

## Current Implementation Status (69% Complete)
1. **Core Calculation Engine**:
   - High-precision planetary calculations using Swiss Ephemeris
   - Accurate ascendant (lagna) calculation with nakshatra and pada information
   - Whole Sign house system implementation (verified and documented)
   - Planetary dignity and retrograde status calculations
   - Ashtakavarga system for planetary and house strength evaluation

2. **User Interface**:
   - Modern, tabbed interface (Chart, Planets, Dasha, Panchang, Yogas, Divisional, Ashtakavarga)
   - D3.js-based chart visualization with enhanced ascendant marker
   - Color-coded planetary dignities
   - Proper formatting for degrees, minutes, and seconds
   - Zodiac and planetary symbols
   - Comprehensive Ashtakavarga visualization with bindu counts

3. **Recent Enhancements**:
   - Implemented complete Ashtakavarga system following classical Parashari rules
   - Added Prastarashtakavarga (individual planet Ashtakavarga) calculations
   - Added Sarvashtakavarga (combined Ashtakavarga) calculations
   - Implemented strength assessment for planets and houses based on bindu counts
   - Created UI for displaying Ashtakavarga data with interactive elements

## Development Guidelines
1. **Architectural Requirements**:
   - Use only Lahiri ayanamsa for calculations
   - Implement only the Whole Sign house system
   - Follow MVP_Roadmap_1.2 as the sole plan until 100% completion
   - Proceed according to Development_protocol.md

2. **Implementation Principles**:
   - Only Vedic astrology features will be added (no Western astrology)
   - Maintain existing capabilities when adding new features
   - Run the application after each feature addition for verification
   - Update GitHub repository after each confirmed feature

## Verification Completed
- Confirmed that the house system implementation correctly uses Whole Sign
- Verified Swiss Ephemeris calls use 'W' parameter for Whole Sign system
- Documented verification in Realigment_protocol.md
- Verified Ashtakavarga calculations match classical Parashari rules
- Confirmed UI displays for Ashtakavarga data are accurate and user-friendly

## Next Steps
Continue implementing features from MVP_Roadmap_1.2, focusing on:
1. Complete Shadbala calculation engine with six-fold strength parameters
2. Specialized strength metrics (Vimsopaka Bala, Ishta-Kashta Phala)
3. Additional dasha systems including Yogini, Kalachakra, and Ashtottari
4. Transit progression engine with date-based predictive indicators
5. Comprehensive Rajayoga detection and strength calculation

## Technical Stack
- Backend: Python with Flask framework
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5
- Visualization: D3.js for chart rendering
- Calculations: Swiss Ephemeris for high-precision astronomical data
- Data Storage: JSON for configuration and test profiles

## Ashtakavarga Implementation Details
The Ashtakavarga system has been implemented with the following components:

1. **Backend**:
   - `AshtakavargaCalculator` class in `ashtakavarga.py` for all calculations
   - Integration with `VedicCalculator` class in `core.py`
   - Methods for accessing individual planet Ashtakavarga and combined Ashtakavarga
   - Strength assessment methods for planets and houses

2. **API**:
   - Extended API response in `app.py` to include Ashtakavarga data
   - Structured data format for Prastarashtakavarga, Sarvashtakavarga, and strength assessments

3. **Frontend**:
   - New "Ashtakavarga" tab in the UI
   - Interactive display of Sarvashtakavarga data
   - Accordion-style display of Prastarashtakavarga data for each planet
   - Tabular display of planet and house strengths

## Testing and Validation
- Comprehensive unit tests in `tests/test_ashtakavarga.py`
- Demo script `test_ashtakavarga_demo.py` for quick verification
- Manual testing through the web interface

## GitHub Repository
All code is maintained in the GitHub repository, with the latest Ashtakavarga implementation committed and pushed.
