# Vedic Kundli Calculator Project Continuation Prompt

## Project Overview
The Vedic Kundli Calculator is a web-based application that provides accurate Vedic astrological calculations and chart visualization. The application follows strict adherence to classical Vedic astrology principles, using the Lahiri ayanamsa and Whole Sign house system exclusively.

## Current Implementation Status (75% Complete)
1. **Core Calculation Engine**:
   - High-precision planetary calculations using Swiss Ephemeris
   - Accurate ascendant (lagna) calculation with nakshatra and pada information
   - Whole Sign house system implementation (verified and documented)
   - Planetary dignity and retrograde status calculations
   - Ashtakavarga system for planetary and house strength evaluation
   - Transit calculations for current planetary positions

2. **User Interface**:
   - Modern, tabbed interface (Chart, Planets, Dasha, Panchang, Yogas, Divisional, Ashtakavarga)
   - D3.js-based chart visualization with enhanced ascendant marker
   - Color-coded planetary dignities
   - Proper formatting for degrees, minutes, and seconds
   - Zodiac and planetary symbols
   - Comprehensive Ashtakavarga visualization with bindu counts
   - Interactive chart elements with tooltips and detailed information panels
   - Transit chart overlay with toggle functionality

3. **Recent Enhancements**:
   - Implemented interactive chart elements allowing users to click on planets and houses
   - Added tooltips for displaying quick information on hover
   - Created detailed information panels for planets and houses when clicked
   - Developed transit chart overlay feature showing current planetary positions
   - Added toggle switch for enabling/disabling transit overlay
   - Implemented visual differentiation between natal and transit planets
   - Added backend endpoint for calculating current transit positions

## Development Guidelines
1. **Architectural Requirements**:
   - Use only Lahiri ayanamsa for calculations
   - Implement only the Whole Sign house system
   - Follow MVP_Roadmap_1.2 as the sole plan until 100% completion
   - Proceed according to Development_protocol.md

2. **Implementation Principles**:
   - Only Vedic astrology features will be added (no Western astrology)
   - Maintain existing capabilities when adding new features
   - Run the application after each feature addition for verification
   - Update GitHub repository after each confirmed feature

## Verification Completed
- Confirmed that the house system implementation correctly uses Whole Sign
- Verified Swiss Ephemeris calls use 'W' parameter for Whole Sign system
- Documented verification in Realigment_protocol.md
- Verified Ashtakavarga calculations match classical Parashari rules
- Confirmed UI displays for Ashtakavarga data are accurate
- Verified interactive chart elements function correctly
- Confirmed transit overlay displays current planetary positions accurately

## Technical Implementation Details

### Interactive Chart Elements
The interactive chart elements were implemented using D3.js event handling:
1. **Planet Interaction**:
   - Hover effects show tooltips with basic planet information
   - Click events display detailed planet information in a side panel
   - Visual feedback on interaction (size change, highlighting)

2. **House Interaction**:
   - Hover effects show tooltips with basic house information
   - Click events display detailed house significations in a side panel
   - Visual feedback on interaction (highlighting house areas)

3. **Information Display**:
   - Tooltips show concise information (planet/house name, sign, position)
   - Detail panels show comprehensive information including:
     - Exact degree position (degrees, minutes, seconds)
     - Dignity status with color coding
     - Motion status (direct/retrograde)
     - Nakshatra placement and lord
     - House significations and rulerships

### Transit Chart Overlay
The transit chart overlay was implemented with these key features:
1. **Backend Support**:
   - New `/get_transits` API endpoint calculates current planetary positions
   - Uses current date/time in UTC for consistent calculations
   - Returns transit data in the same format as birth chart data

2. **Frontend Implementation**:
   - Toggle switch for enabling/disabling transit overlay
   - Visual differentiation between natal and transit planets
     - Natal planets: solid colored circles
     - Transit planets: white circles with dashed borders
   - Interactive elements for transit planets (tooltips, detail panels)
   - Legend explaining the difference between natal and transit planets
   - Timestamp showing when transit calculations were performed

3. **User Experience**:
   - Intuitive toggle for showing/hiding transits
   - Clear visual distinction between natal and transit planets
   - Detailed information available for both natal and transit planets
   - Smooth transitions and interactions

## Next Steps
Continue implementing features from MVP_Roadmap_1.2 and Frontend_Roadmap_1.3, focusing on:
1. Aspect visualization and interpretation
2. Predictive timeline visualization
3. Enhanced divisional chart implementation
4. Advanced strength calculation architecture
5. Specialized analytical modules

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5, D3.js
- **Backend**: Python, Flask, Swiss Ephemeris
- **Data Storage**: JSON files for static data
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
